Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, and they play a crucial role in many algorithms and applications. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in the tree is called the root.

Here are some key points about binary trees:

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data, known as the key or value, and references to its left and right children (which can be NULL if the child doesn't exist).

2. **Root**: The topmost node of the tree is called the root. It is the starting point for accessing the tree's elements.

3. **Parent, Child, and Siblings**: Nodes in a binary tree are connected in parent-child relationships. A node's children are nodes directly beneath it, and nodes with the same parent are called siblings.

4. **Depth and Height**: The depth of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges from the root to that node. The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree.

5. **Traversal**: There are several ways to traverse (visit) all the nodes in a binary tree:
   - Inorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.
   - Preorder Traversal: Visit the current node, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
   - Postorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the current node.
   - Level-order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.

6. **Types of Binary Trees**:
   - **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
   - **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
   - **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children, and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
   - **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by no more than one.

7. **Applications**: Binary trees are used in various applications such as expression parsing, binary search, Huffman encoding, representing hierarchical data, and much more.

In C, binary trees can be implemented using structures to define the nodes and pointers to represent the connections between nodes. Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal can be implemented recursively or iteratively depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.
